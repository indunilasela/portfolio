# Portfolio Website

This is my first portfolio project built with React and Vite.

## Technologies Used

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- EmailJS for contact form

## Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features

- Responsive design
- Dark theme
- Contact form with email functionality
- Project showcase
- Skills section
- Smooth animations
